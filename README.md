# ShapeMaker

ShapeMaker is a fun, relaxing, turn your brain off type of application! All you do is start clicking and dragging to make shapes in different colors!

Born as a personal passion project, this has been incredibly fun to work on and challenging in a new exciting way. My main goal with this project has been to push myself to make something awesome and addictive using vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation. The biggest challenge has definitely been implementing dynamically applied event listeners without relying on any external libraries!

I hope you'll give ShapeMaker a try and enjoy the heck out of it!
